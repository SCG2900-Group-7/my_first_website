Sovas Style and Coding Guidelines:


Colour:
* White for the header & button text in about, why sovas?, and pricing page. Black for the rest of the text
* Black text for all of the homepage. 
* Orange, red, yellow and pinkish brown gradient for the header picture (picture


Main color palette: 
 - (Oranges: #f97850, #fb4d38)
 - (Reds: #fb0c3a, #f90d1b, #fc1e54)
 - (Yellow: #fc9c64)
 - (Pink: #e6b4b2, #eb948c, #fc5c64) - in gradient.


  - Yellow (#fc9c64) illustrations across the site sourced from many pixels.co. 
  - Footer will include the company name (i.e. Sovas) and will include Contact, Terms & Conditions & Privacy Policy
  - Contact will not lead anywhere, but hovering over it will pop up a box with our email
  - Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy will lead to their own respective webpages. These pages will be updated with CSS in our final deliverable. 


Typography:
* Inter, Sans serif font
* https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter
* Text size will vary between pages in the range of 100px to 1.1rem. 
* The button text sizes will remain the same at 1.1rem. 






Home:
* Include 2 buttons: One to jump to the bottom of the page to explain how Sovas works briefly, and another one to go straight to Why Sovas?
* Have the contact email bar at the bottom at all times






About:
* Our mission to make language learning simpler
* Add memojis to represent ourselves


Why Sovas?:
* Created a grid where the text and images crisscross positions every time
* Alternate between text on left and image on right and text on right and image on left
* Include a large box at the bottom to entice the user to sign up for Sovas!


Pricing Plans:


* Create three different boxes, each with their own payment plan
* The first is basic, which will be about 10 bucks a month, which will give the user some basic features such as 5 avatars, 2 languages they can learn (of their choosing), and regular priority email (idk, 7 days max?) & live chat support
* Standard will have to be quite a bit more expensive but also will have all the features. Let’s make it maybe… 45 dollars? Might be a bit steep but we can decide later
* Access to all avatars and languages
* Priority email support (probably max a day response time) and chat support
* Now the big plan, the commercial plan, will include everything that the Standard plan gives, but could be used by multiple users at once via multi-user migration
* Price will be decided on a case by case basis 






Reviews:


* Thought about having it at the bottom of the product features page, but there might be a better place for it somewhere else (currently omitted from the website but may come back)


NOTE: As of October 24th, 2021 the home page is not responsive on Google Chrome (the image is shortened), but works properly on Safari. This is currently being investigated.
